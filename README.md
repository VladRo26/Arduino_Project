# **How it works?**
-You need to use the keypad to insert the defuse code of the bomb, which is the same as in CS:GO(7355608)

-You will see the text displayed on the LCD Screen.

-You have 16 seconds to defuse the bomb. After this ammount of time the bomb will explode.

-The LED will blink depending on the remaining time, and if the bomb explodes it will turn yellow.

-You have one try to hit the right code. If you enter it correctly the LED will become green.
